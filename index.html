                    This website's sole purpose is to modernly and eloquently
                    express my love for my nikki through poetry in a digital way. 
                    Within these pages, poems are made from my profound love for her.
                    Each verse are crafted from my heart that beats her name.

                <p id="motive-p">
                    There were times when showing my love for her is so hard, those 
                    times drove me to the idea of making a digital poem monument for her; 
                    immortalizing her through the internet.
                    Since I am studying web development, and I am under the course of
                    Computer Science, I decided to make this website.

                    myself with, the coffee I’d look for each morning, 
                    the song I’d play on repeat, the taste my lips long for, 
                    the beauty my eyes seek to forevermore gaze. 
                    You are everything to me. I am yours, always.

                    In the midst of war of which you were the wicked, still, I’d fight with you. 
                    In the language of which only you speak, I am not in need for translation;
